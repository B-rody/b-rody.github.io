I’m an *AI & Automation Product Manager* who turns repetitive tasks into intelligent automation and business impact.

<br>

## Current Focus
1. Productionizing the multi-agent execution layer (scale + isolation + auditability)
2. Designing revenue-linked automation systems (measurable lift vs. manual baseline)
3. Establishing guardrails and governance for agent safety and business risk mitigation

## Business Outcomes
Some metrics representing the impact of automation throughout my career
- **Configuration piplines, debugging scripts, and automatic alerting:**
    -  Enabled 2 200+ hours/year of reclaimed dev time and 10 % higher project concurrency
- **Multi-agent cloud modernization ecosystem:**
    - Reduced discovery and planning by 75% (based on initial tests)

Below are system-level patterns and personal projects that reflect the same principles.

## System Outcomes
Across my work, both professionally and personally, a few consistent patterns emerge:
- **Workflow automation:** Automating repetitive steps to reclaim focus
- **Structured Insights:** Transforming unorganized data into usable signals
- **Stable Execution:** Designing automation that manages LLM variability and maintains consistency in results
