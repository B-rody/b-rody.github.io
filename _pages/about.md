I'm an AI Automation PM who likes making work smoother. I enjoy turning complex, repetitive processes into clear, reliable systems.

Whether at scale or in side projects, I focus on automation that saves time and lets ideas move faster.


## What I Do

I work as an AI Automation Product Manager, helping teams turn emerging AI capabilities into dependable, scalable tools — and applying those same principles in my own builds.

- Translate emerging AI capabilities into tools that solve real business and developer problems.  
- Design and deliver automation workflows that eliminate bottlenecks and free teams to focus on higher-value work.  
- Help engineering teams build and integrate AI and automation into production systems safely and reliably.  
- Apply enterprise-scale reliability and discipline to small, fast-moving experiments.

## Experience Highlights
I’ve spent the last several years building AI and automation platforms that improve efficiency and deliver measurable business results.

- **Microsoft — AI Automation & DevEx PM (2022–Present)**  
  Shipped agent-based solutions that cut cloud-modernization effort by ~75%, driving $1.6M+ in revenue.  
  Founded the *AI-enabled App Modernization Factory*, reducing refactor timelines 40%.

- **Microsoft — Azure Apps, Infra & Security PM (2019–2022)**  
  Led global identity and security services ($6M direct, $74M+ pipeline).  
  Built region-portability tooling that unlocked $168M+ in contracts and simplified compliance.  

- **Microsoft — Azure Solutions Consultant (2017–2019)**  
  Modernized 1,700+ enterprise apps to cloud-native architectures.  
  Created CI/CD, config-as-code, and identity debugging automation saving 2,200+ hours of manual effort each year.  

- **Siemens Healthineers — Software Engineer (2016–2017)**  
  Contributed to regulated ultrasound software and framework upgrades used in clinical systems.  

<em>Those experiences taught me how to design automation that’s dependable. I use the same approach in smaller, independent projects that push creativity and speed.</em>

## Independent Projects
Outside of work, I build tools that explore AI-assisted creation and automation. I also do other technical and creative projects.

| Project | Purpose | More |
|---------|----------|------|
| **AssetForge** | End-to-end pipeline that researches, generates, and packages digital product ideas using LLMs | [Read](/projects/assetforge/) |
| **InsiderScraper** | Parses SEC insider-trade filings into structured, queryable data for market research | [Read](/projects/insiderscraper/) |
| **Shipped 3D Game** | Small single-player puzzle horror game | [Read](/projects/shipped-3d-game/) |

## How I Work
1. Start with repeatable systems, not one-off fixes.  
2. Prototype fast, then measure (against a baseline!) and iterate.  
3. Write everything down. Clear documentation makes tools easier to adopt, understand, and enhance. 
4. Use AI to amplify human judgment, not replace it.
5. Every launch should teach something that makes the next one better.

## Skills in Practice

| Focus | Applied To | Outcome |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Workflow automation | Automating repetitive tasks | 75% time savings; faster iteration cycles |
| Structured extraction | Messy enterprise or market data | Clean, reusable inputs for analytics |
| AI-assisted generation | Content and asset generation | Consistent quality at lower manual cost |
